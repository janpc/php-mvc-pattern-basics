## About The Project

In this project I create a music website where you can see the information of songs and artists.

The website is capable of displaying the name, pictures, some information, nad some songs of an artist and the name, album, cover and the artists of a song. You can also play the song, edit any information, delete a song or artist and add new songs or artists.

TO do that is using a local database with mySql.

The information in the database is the following:

1. Songs
In this table you will obtain information about the songs:
  song_id
  song_name
  cover
  src (where the song is located)
  album

1. Artists
In this table you will obtain information about the artists:
  artist_id
  artist_name
  picture
  info

3. song_artist
In this table you will obtain the relation between songs and artists:
  song_id
  artist_id
